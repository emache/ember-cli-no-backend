<p>Back in January, I decided that 2014 would be my 'learn to be a front-end developer' year. With only some (outdated) knowledge in HTML and CSS, I have a lot of catching up to do. That, and learning Javascript.</p>
<p>I have a learning list to work my way through (coming soon to this website), which includes web experiments of various sizes. This website, in essence, is my playground and the embodiement of the skills I am learning.</p>
<p>Each experiment will be filed under the 'projects' section.</p>
<h5>But where do I find the time?</h5>
<p>Between a full-time job and other things, it may seems pretty difficult to see when I could dedicate a significant amount of time to learn programming. But as people say these days, <em>we don't find time, we make it.</em> But can you?</p>

<p>There is a fair amount of variation between each day, but weekdays are pretty full. I have on average 2 hours each evening to browse the Internet and skype with my friends. That is the time I can also dedicate to working on this blog. The amount of time is not sufficient for me to do a significant amount of coding, however it is enough to let me work on some illustrations and the content of the articles.</p>
<p>Weekends are where most of the programming learning is done. I try to dedicate some time to read, test and write some bits here and there.</p>
